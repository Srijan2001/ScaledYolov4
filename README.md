# ScaledYolov4
In this project, I have trained a deep neural network on official SAR (Search and Rescue) dataset for drones on the IPSAR (Image Processing for Search and Rescue) project. Scaled YOLOv4 has been employed in the model that detects humans in images, which will be used on drones in missing person cases in terrain that cannot be searched by humans.
